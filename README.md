## Changes
I made a few changes to the mod:
1. Through the config screen, you can now show/hide the cursor while in orthocam. This only hides the cursor in ortho, not first or third person.
2. Since the clouds obfuscate a lot in earlier versions, there is a setting to disable clouds in ortho. This only hides the clouds in ortho, not first or third person.

## How to build

`gradlew build`

## Permissions
Feel free to use Legacy OrthoCamera in any mods or modpacks.
